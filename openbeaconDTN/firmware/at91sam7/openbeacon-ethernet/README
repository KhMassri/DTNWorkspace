1.  INTRODUCTION

RFID Realtime Tracking System

Location  tracking  using  OpenBeacon  tags can be implemented by
running a OpenBeacon tag firmware that regularly transmits beacon
packets.   Such  packets  can  then  be  received  by  OpenBeacon
EasyReader PoE II base stations in the vicinity. Signals received
by one or more base stations can then be used to estimate the po-
sition of the tag. Optional encryption can make sure,  that  only
base stations inside the system can read the packet information.

Usually  such readers are used in combination with OpenBeacon Ac-
tive 2.4GHz Proximity RFID tags - which  were  co-developed  with
the SocioPatterns project.

In  this directory you can find the OpenBeacon EasyReaderPoE base
station firmware source code. You can find more information here:

2.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Although the code contributions are acknowledged  in  the  source
code  headers  and  history  log  files  of  the  GIT  repository
(http://goo.gl/bE8Ig), this project lives  from  invaluable  user
contributions  like  rigorous testing, constant suggestion of new
features and regular real-life deployments in the field.

The OpenBeacon Team especially wants to thank  Ciro  Cattuto  and
Luca  Cappa  from ISI Foundation for the enriching collaboration,
the ongoing moral support, helpful  and  innovative  suggestions,
tireless testing and innovative deployments of our RFID readers.

We also want to thank the SocioPatterns project for providing the
scientific background for our platform, the  media  exposure  and
the deployments needed for the survival of our project.

4.  PROJECT DEPENDENCIES

4.1 lwIP TCP/IP Stack

lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol
suite that has been developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and
Networks Architectures (CNA) lab at the Swedish Institute of Com-
puter Science (SICS).

The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the  RAM
usage while still having a full scale TCP. This making lwIP suit-
able for use in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes  of  free
RAM  and  room  for  around  40  kilobytes  of code ROM. See net-
work/README.lwip for more information.

4.2 FreeRTOS.org Posix Compliant Realtime Operating System

FreeRTOS is a scaleable real-time  kernel  designed  specifically
for  small  embedded  systems.  Please  refer  to  ../core/os/li-
cense.txt for more information.

4.3 FatFs FAT File System Implementation

FatFs is a generic FAT file system module for small embedded sys-
tems.  The  FatFs  is  written in compliance with ANSI C and com-
pletely separated from the disk I/O layer. Please refer to appli-
cation/fatfs/00readme.txt for more information.


5.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION

5.1 OpenBeacon.org

The  http://OpenBeacon.org  project was founded by Milosch Meriac
and Brita Meriac in 2006 at the Berlin located  company  Bitmanu-
faktur  GmbH as an open platform for active RFID applications op-
erating in the license free 2.4GHz ISM band. OpenBeacon is  based
on  Open Source software and a very flexible and a open design of
a reprogrammable low cost Open Source Active 2.4GHz RFID hardware
module.  The  RFID  tag and reader firmware sources are available
under GPL license the and tag hardware schematics  are  available
under  the open Creative Commons license. We encourage the devel-
opment of new ideas for OpenBeacon setups and  firmware  improve-
ments.

5.2 SocioPatterns

The  http://SocioPatterns.org  sensing  platform employs wearable
electronic badges to sense sustained face-to-face  proximity  be-
tween  persons  -  a proxy observable for social contact - with a
fine spatial and temporal resolution. It has so far been utilized
in  fourteen  deployments in which the SocioPatterns team was di-
rectly involved. Further  deployments  are  being  prepared.  The
platform  has  additionally been adopted by other research groups
and commercial entities which have deployed it and/or are prepar-
ing  future  deployments.  Complementing  the development of this
sensing platform, the SocioPatterns team also works on the devel-
opment  of tools and techniques to facilitate the representation,
analysis and visualization of the data obtained from  this  plat-
form.

SocioPatterns is an interdisciplinary scientific research project
that adopts this data-driven methodology with the aim of uncover-
ing fundamental patterns in social dynamics and coordinated human
activity.

To achieve its scientific goals, the SocioPatterns  project  also
considers  the  development  of new means for obtaining pertinent
but unavailable data. The first major result in this  respect  is
the SocioPatterns sensing platform, which was developed to obtain
longitudinal datasets on face-to-face contact events with the de-
sired scale and resolution.

The  SocioPatterns project is a collaboration between researchers
and developers from the following institutions and companies:

- ISI Foundation -- Turin, Italy

- CNRS - Centre de Physique Theorique -- Marseille, France

- ENS Lyon - Laboratoire de Physique -- Lyon, France

- Bitmanufaktur -- Berlin, Germany
