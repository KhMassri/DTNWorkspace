1.  INTRODUCTION

Active 2.4 GHz RFID Realtime Proximity and Position Tracking

Location tracking using OpenBeacon tags can be implemented by running a OpenBeacon proximity tag firmware that regularly transmits beacon packets. Such packets can then be received by OpenBeacon EasyReader PoE II base stations in the vicinity. Signals received by one or more base stations can then be used to estimate the position of the tag.

The proximity feature additionally allows to resolve human contacts by sending detecting other tags in a range of up to 2 meters and a resolution of 0.5 meters. Once a contact is detected, that information is forwarded via PoE Ethernet readers to the server infrastructure. Due to the shielding effect of the body, face-to-face contacts can be accurately detected. Optional encryption can make sure, that only base stations inside the system can read the packet information.

The Active 2.4 GHz Proximity Tag was co-developed with the SocioPatterns.org project.

As proximity sensing needs additional battery power you might consider using the ../tag source tree for tracking-only mode (roughly 12 times the battery runtime compared to a proximity tag solution).

2.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Although the code contributions are acknowledged in the source code headers and history log files of the GIT repository (http://goo.gl/bE8Ig), this project lives from invaluable user contributions like rigorous testing, constant suggestion of new features and regular real-life deployments in the field.

The OpenBeacon Team wants to thank Ciro Cattuto from ISI Foundation implementing the first proximity tag PIC firmware, the great collaboration with ISI during the joint development, the ongoing moral support and innovative deployments of our RFID systems.

We especially want to thank Ciro and the SocioPatterns project for providing the scientific background for our platform, the media exposure and the deployments needed for the survival of our project.

4.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION

4.1 OpenBeacon.org

The http://OpenBeacon.org project was founded by Milosch Meriac and Brita Meriac in 2006 at the Berlin located company Bitmanufaktur GmbH as an open platform for active RFID applications operating in the license free 2.4GHz ISM band. OpenBeacon is based on Open Source software and a very flexible and a open design of a reprogrammable low cost Open Source Active 2.4GHz RFID hardware module. The RFID tag and reader firmware 
sources are available under GPL license the and tag hardware schematics are available under the open Creative Commons license. We encourage the development of new ideas for OpenBeacon setups and firmware improvements.

4.2 SocioPatterns

The http://SocioPatterns.org sensing platform employs wearable electronic badges to sense sustained face-to-face proximity between persons - a proxy observable for social contact - with a fine spatial and temporal resolution. It has so far been utilized in fourteen deployments in which the SocioPatterns team was directly involved. Further deployments are being prepared. The platform has additionally been adopted by other research groups and commercial entities which have deployed it and/or are preparing future deployments. Complementing the development of this sensing platform, the SocioPatterns team also works on the development of tools and techniques to facilitate the representation, analysis and visualization of the data obtained from this platform.

SocioPatterns is an interdisciplinary scientific research project that adopts this data-driven methodology with the aim of uncovering fundamental patterns in social dynamics and coordinated human activity.

To achieve its scientific goals, the SocioPatterns project also considers the development of new means for obtaining pertinent but unavailable data. The first major result in this respect is the SocioPatterns sensing platform, which was developed to obtain longitudinal datasets on face-to-face contact events with the desired scale and resolution.

The SocioPatterns project is a collaboration between researchers and developers from the following institutions and companies:

- ISI Foundation -- Turin, Italy

- CNRS - Centre de Physique Theorique -- Marseille, France

- ENS Lyon - Laboratoire de Physique -- Lyon, France

- Bitmanufaktur -- Berlin, Germany
