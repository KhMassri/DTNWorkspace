Introduction

SocioPatterns  is  an  interdisciplinary  scientific research  project that
adopts this data-driven methodology with the aim of uncovering  fundamental
patterns in social dynamics and coordinated human activity.

To achieve its scientific goals, the SocioPatterns  project also  considers
the development of new means for obtaining pertinent but unavailable data.
The first major result in this respect is the SocioPatterns sensing
platform, which was developed to  obtain  longitudinal datasets on face-to-
face contact events with the desired scale and resolution.

The SocioPatterns  sensing platform employs  wearable  electronic badges to
sense sustained face-to-face  proximity between persons –a proxy observable
for social contact– with a fine spatial  and temporal resolution. It has so
far been utilized in fourteen deployments in  which  the SocioPatterns team
was directly involved. Further deployments are being prepared. The platform
has additionally  been  adopted by other  research  groups  and  commercial
entities which have  deployed it and/or  are  preparing  future deployments.
Complementing the development  of  this sensing platform, the SocioPatterns
team also works on the development of tools  and  techniques  to facilitate
the representation, analysis  and  visualization  of the data obtained from
this platform.

The SocioPatterns project is a collaboration between researchers and
developers from the following institutions and companies:

    ISI Foundation – Turin, Italy
    CNRS - Centre de Physique Théorique – Marseille, France
    ENS Lyon - Laboratoire de Physique – Lyon, France
    Bitmanufaktur – Berlin, Germany

It is led by:

    Ciro Cattuto (ISI Foundation)
    Alain Barrat (CPT, CNRS & ISI Foundation)
    Wouter Van den Broeck (ISI Foundation)
