Contains all the router classes who decide how to handle the messages.
All router classes must be in this package and must extend the 
{@link routing.MessageRouter} (when creating new routers, extending
{@link routing.ActiveRouter} might make sense) class so they can be
dynamically loaded to the simulator. The classes to load can be specified
through {@link core.Settings} class' settings source. See MessageRouter class 
and classes extending it for details about the settings.


Te structure in the package is the Following:

MessageRouter
	DTNRouter (Implements DTN protocol, take messages from generator and send to receiver)
		Direct Delivery
		Prohpet
		ecc ecc
	GeneratorRouter (only generate message and send to the first DTNRouter that it meets)
		TimeBased 
		LocationBased
		EventBased
	ReceiverRouter (Receive Message from DTNRouter)
		Sink (share queue)
		Single
